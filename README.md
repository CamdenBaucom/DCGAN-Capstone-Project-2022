# Charlottesville High School Senior Year Engineering Capstone Project

## TRUTH-DCGAN

The purpose of this project has been to revisualize the way that we interact with history. Utilizing neural networks, and more specifically Generative Adversarial Networks, we can create new photos from events that happened more than one hundred years ago. These new images can't show new information, but they can show a prevailing sentiment. This particular project is centered on the Tulsa Race Massacre, the deadliest event of racial terrorism in American history. This project in no way aims to trivialize or minimize the horrors of that event, but rather to get people to interact with the history in a new way. The linked Google Colab document (TRUTHmodel_DCGAN.ipynb) shows all of the commented code and 16 generated images from one execution of the code. A selected sample of generated images from nine different executions is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1C6tJaB6AXQHEs2HY2A62qHAJXgUtQbNQFWDr3GH1fn8/edit?usp=sharing).
